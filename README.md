# gen_autoDJ
An automatic DJ Winamp plugin, fading songs in and out at configurable amplitude points.
* Just give it a big list of your favourites and it'll randomly play them whenever dead air approaches.
* Skips past quiet/silent starts, and fades out before quiet/silent endings.
* Manually start other tracks, and it will work around you.
* Works with most audio formats, and karaoke tracks too.
